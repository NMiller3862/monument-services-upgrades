# Quick Reference: AI Upgrade Capability

## TL;DR

**Can AI handle this upgrade?**

| Upgrade Type | AI Suitable? | Why | Recommendation |
|--------------|--------------|-----|-----------------|
| Java 11 → 17 | ✅ YES | Mostly mechanical | Use AI |
| Spring Boot 2.5 → 3.3 | ❌ NO | Test infrastructure too complex | Use human expert |
| Spring Boot 3.2 → 3.3 | ✅ MAYBE | Minor version, might work | Try AI, have expert ready |
| Library update (same major) | ✅ YES | Clear changelog | Use AI |
| Security patch | ✅ YES | Straightforward version bump | Use AI |
| Gradle 7 → 8 | ✅ YES | Usually backward compatible | Use AI |
| Hibernate 5 → 6 | ❌ NO | Major version, test issues | Use human expert |
| JUnit 4 → 5 | ❌ NO | Test framework changes | Use human expert |

## Decision Tree

```
Is this a major version upgrade?
├─ YES → Is it a framework?
│  ├─ YES → Involve human expert
│  └─ NO → Might be OK with AI
└─ NO → Proceed with AI

Are there significant test infrastructure changes?
├─ YES → Involve human expert
└─ NO → Proceed with AI

Is the framework well-documented?
├─ NO → Involve human expert
└─ YES → Proceed with AI

Are there known migration issues?
├─ YES → Involve human expert
└─ NO → Proceed with AI
```

**If all answers are NO, then AI can handle it.**

## What AI Can Do (95%+ Success)

- ✅ Update dependency versions in build.gradle
- ✅ Replace imports mechanically (javax → jakarta)
- ✅ Update known API usages
- ✅ Update configuration files
- ✅ Resolve dependency conflicts (when errors are clear)
- ✅ Parallel processing of multiple files
- ✅ Generate migration reports

---

## What AI Cannot Do (10% Success)

- ❌ Debug framework internals
- ❌ Understand why auto-configuration doesn't trigger
- ❌ Mock complex framework objects (JPA Metamodel)
- ❌ Read framework source code
- ❌ Know when to stop trying and ask for help
- ❌ Understand framework-specific behavior changes
- ❌ Perform iterative hypothesis testing

## Time Estimates

### Spring Boot 2.5 → 3.3 Upgrade

| Phase | With AI Only | With Human Expert | Difference |
|-------|--------------|-------------------|-----------|
| Code migration | 14 hours | 14 hours | - |
| Test debugging | 40+ hours | 4-8 hours | **32-36 hours saved** |
| **Total** | **54+ hours** | **20-25 hours** | **29-34 hours saved** |
| Success rate | ~40% | ~95% | **55% improvement** |

## Cost-Benefit Analysis

### Option 1: AI Only
- Time: 54+ hours
- Cost: $0 (AI labor)
- Success rate: ~40%
- Result: Incomplete upgrade, stuck on test failures

### Option 2: AI + Human Expert (4-8 hours)
- Time: 20-25 hours
- Cost: $500-1000 (expert labor)
- Success rate: ~95%
- Result: Complete upgrade, all tests passing

### Option 3: Human Expert Only
- Time: 30-40 hours
- Cost: $1500-2000 (expert labor)
- Success rate: ~95%
- Result: Complete upgrade, all tests passing

**Recommendation: Option 2 (AI + Human Expert)**
- Fastest path to success
- Lowest cost
- Highest success rate
- Leaves codebase in good state

---

## Red Flags (Involve Human Expert)

🚩 Major version upgrade (2.x → 3.x)
🚩 Framework-specific changes (Spring, Hibernate, JUnit)
🚩 Test infrastructure changes
🚩 No clear migration guide
🚩 Known issues in migration path
🚩 Complex dependency chains
🚩 Multiple services affected
🚩 Tight deadline (can't afford to get stuck)

---

## Green Lights (AI Can Handle)

✅ Minor version upgrade (3.2 → 3.3)
✅ Library update (same major version)
✅ Security patch
✅ Build system update (Gradle, Maven)
✅ Code style/formatting
✅ Dependency cleanup
✅ Single service affected
✅ Flexible deadline

---

## What to Do If Stuck

**If AI gets stuck on test failures:**

1. **Stop trying to debug** (AI will keep failing)
2. **Hire a human expert** (4-8 hours to fix)
3. **Or use Testcontainers** (10-20 hours to implement)
4. **Or revert the upgrade** (2-4 hours to revert)

**Do NOT spend 40+ hours debugging with AI.**

## For Your Organization

### Current Spring Boot Upgrade Status

| Service | Status | Tests | Recommendation |
|---------|--------|-------|-----------------|
| account-service | Upgraded | 538/758 passing | Hire expert to fix |
| base-service | Upgraded | Builds OK | Hire expert to test |
| common-payment-lib | Upgraded | Builds OK | Hire expert to test |
| payment-service | NOT UPGRADED | - | Don't start yet |
| sf-integration-service | NOT UPGRADED | - | Don't start yet |

### Immediate Action

**Option A: Hire Spring Expert (RECOMMENDED)**
- Cost: $500-1000
- Time: 4-8 hours
- Result: All services upgraded and tested
- Recommendation: ✅ DO THIS

**Option B: Use Testcontainers**
- Cost: $0 (internal team)
- Time: 10-20 hours
- Result: All services upgraded and tested
- Recommendation: ⚠️ CONSIDER THIS

**Option C: Revert to Spring Boot 2.5.12**
- Cost: $0 (internal team)
- Time: 2-4 hours
- Result: Back to original state
- Risk: Security vulnerabilities remain
- Recommendation: ❌ AVOID THIS

## Key Takeaway

**AI is great at code migration, but terrible at debugging framework internals.**

Since both are required for a successful framework upgrade, **major framework upgrades are not suitable for AI-driven automation**.

**Use AI for the easy parts, use humans for the hard parts.**

## Questions to Ask Before Starting

1. Is this a major version upgrade? → If YES, involve human expert
2. Are there test infrastructure changes? → If YES, involve human expert
3. Is the framework well-documented? → If NO, involve human expert
4. Are there known migration issues? → If YES, involve human expert
5. Do we have a tight deadline? → If YES, involve human expert

**If you answer YES to any of these, involve a human expert upfront.**
